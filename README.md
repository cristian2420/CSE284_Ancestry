# Evaluation of algorithms for infering local ancestry in Admixed American (AMR) populations
## Final project for CSE 284 (WI24)

G-Nomix (https://github.com/AI-sandbox/gnomix), RFMix v2 (https://github.com/slowkoni/rfmix) and MOSAIC (https://github.com/mststats/MOSAIC) were compared to assess their performance on infering local ancestry across different sample sizes.

### Datasets
The Admixed American (AMR) population of the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 dataset was used to ran each software using the rest of the populations as reference

### Software descriptions

| Software  | Algorithm | Pre-phasing | Gen map |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| RFMix  | random forest  | required | yes |
| MOSAIC | two layer HMM  | required | yes |
| G-Nomix  |   |  |  |


### Running each software
We ran each software using default parameters as follows:

**RFMix v2**
